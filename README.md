# Lamini Language Model Tuning

This repository demonstrates how to tune a language model using the Lamini API, which allows you to fine-tune a large language model (LLM) for specific tasks.

## Overview

The provided Python script connects to the Lamini API, retrieves a predefined dataset of Q&A pairs, and fine-tunes a pre-existing LLM model (`meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct`). The model is tuned using the dataset and a set of hyperparameters, which can be adjusted to optimize the model further for specific tasks.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Lamini API key (free tokens provided upon signup)
- Neo4j database (optional, if using graph-related tasks)

## Installation

1. Install required dependencies using `pip`:

   ```bash
   pip install lamini
   ```

2. Install additional dependencies for connecting to a Neo4j database if needed (optional):

   ```bash
   pip install neo4j langchain_community
   ```

3. Obtain an API key from Lamini. You can sign up at [Lamini](https://lamini.ai) to get your API key.

## Usage

1. Set up the Lamini API key in your environment or directly in the code:

   ```python
   lamini.api_key = "your_api_key_here"
   ```

2. Define the dataset with input-output pairs (as shown in the `get_data()` function) that will be used to tune the model:

   ```python
   def get_data():
       data = [
           {
               "input": "Are there any step-by-step tutorials or walkthroughs available in the documentation?",
               "output": "Yes, there are step-by-step tutorials and walkthroughs available in the documentation section. Hereâ€™s an example for using Lamini to get insights into any python SDK: https://lamini-ai.github.io/example/",
           },
           ...
       ]
       return data
   ```

3. Initialize the Lamini model you want to fine-tune. In this case, we use `meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct`:

   ```python
   llm = Lamini(model_name="meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct")
   ```

4. Pass the dataset to the model for tuning, specifying the hyperparameters for training:

   ```python
   data = get_data()

   llm.tune(data_or_dataset_id=data,
            finetune_args={'learning_rate': 1.0e-4})
   ```

   - **learning_rate**: The learning rate for fine-tuning (adjustable).
   - **early_stopping**: Optionally use early stopping if needed (defaults to False).
   - **max_steps**: Maximum number of training steps (optional).
   - **optim**: The optimizer to use, e.g., `adam` (optional).

### Hyperparameters

Common hyperparameters that can be tuned include:

- `learning_rate` (float): The learning rate of the model.
- `early_stopping` (bool): Whether to use early stopping during training.
- `max_steps` (int): The maximum number of steps to train for.
- `optim` (str): The optimizer to use, e.g., `adam` or `sgd`.

### Example Dataset

The dataset used for fine-tuning includes a list of Q&A pairs, as seen in the `get_data()` function. You can adjust this dataset as per your needs to create a specialized fine-tuned model.

```python
{
    "input": "What does it mean to cancel a job using the `cancel_job()` function? Can we stop the machine from doing its task?",
    "output": "The `cancel_job()` function is used to stop a tuning job that is currently running."
}
```

## Notes

- You can adjust the dataset and hyperparameters according to the task at hand.
- Lamini offers powerful capabilities for hyperparameter tuning and model fine-tuning, making it easier to customize models for specific use cases.
- The fine-tuning process is automated and utilizes various optimization techniques to improve model performance.
